# FUTILE

holy crap.  we are at the end...  i can feel it.  your lack of involvement dissolves me from blame bro...  you ever get this high then you have what you want lol...  so yeah crimes up here dont count lol...  did you see the artificial barrier???  its right there lol...  i dont think i'll ever legitimately see another one of these phases anymore.  the price is your life lol.  what happened here bro???  you dont even come around anymore.  just retard cloning i swear i''m causing it...

why you come by here so weak and pussy like and you did the worst one you could do and it was an easy climb.  just nobody wanted to consider this a task you need to feed for???  i guess its a very awkward sensation...  i dont know bro.  you left a mess last i was here...  i notice i come here for a weird reason nowadays.  i'm already done with this place personally.

yo bro.  i came back.  cause i saw your clones.  17 clones for one real commit but it was two together...

i dont know man.  i feel stupid.  this thing went nowhere and i'm no closer to monees.  i dont recognize this as work for some reason...  perhaps i have done this kind of shit for a while now and i can't tell the difference when something is real or not...  you know???  no???  why not?  we been here for how long and i'm still chasing your unique viewers...

so yeah after all that warning...  i think this thing is not worth my time but you say so.  i have a feeling i'm losing every day.  this seriously sucks bro.  i'm not doing anything of value lol...  but you say so...

so yeah, i dont know what we want here.  me, i come here for reasons like processing logic...  it didn't cause any grief lol..  bro...  how long you gonna take...  i dont know anymore...  brain is failing bro...  this goes nowhere lol... thats why...

hmmm.  oh yeah i am done with this place lol...  come on man, just accept it. i dont want to deal with whatever crap you have for probably more frying.  i dont know man.  this place is over lol.. and i'm not done the logic and processing lol...  oh well it was always meant to be like this.  dont pay again huh?
